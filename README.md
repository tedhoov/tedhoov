> I love to learn and web development is a fun challenge I look forward to utilizing as a web developer and graphic artist after graduating. Although I'm still new to coding, I catch on quickly and enjoy finding ways to improve efficiency. I do already enjoy creating digital art for my friends and myself in my free time. My favorite application is Clip Studio Art, but I am also proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Thank you for checking out my profile! Feel free to check out my links below.
